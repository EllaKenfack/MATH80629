We'll get through this, but I hope afterwards we understand how important universal healthcare is, and socialism in general. It's funny how our society very quickly turned rather left-leaning to combat this, almost like this is the world should behave in general. Now we see a bunch of economics demand blood sacrifices to oil the gears of capitalism. I can't believe it - we have to kill people to make sure our economy stays afloat? Not right. Must change."}

Of course the issue is moderately severe but the actual death rate of Covid-19 is between 0.9% and 3%, which is nowhere near as bad as viral outbreaks in the past.

I feel like the science is unclear because we do not have enough information, and that we (our governments) are not equipped to make the best decisions because they do not have the wherewithal to improve their information very quickly. I feel that there's a desire to 'do the right thing', but that the consequences and impacts of the choices being made are not clearly understood. I feel like we're being held hostage by an 'enemy' that, while dangerous for a proportion of society, may prove to be significantly less formidable than thought with the benefit of hindsight. I feel like our personal and physical connections are a huge part of what defines our humanity, and that restricting them has hidden consequences, particularly for those who are vulnerable with mental health difficulties. I feel that - despite our being aware that pandemics are increasingly likely in our world, thanks to our global economy, the effectiveness of medicine in treating 'regular' diseases, etc. - we as a society were under-prepared, preferring to not spend the necessary money to protect us better. I feel like there's a lack of understanding of the difficulties inherent in preventing viral spread, but also an over-reaction in policing people's lives and the sacrifice of personal liberty. I feel depressed that this unprecedented situation will likely be used as an excuse\/justification for issues in the future, and may hamper our ability to tackle other pressing problems in the world.

I am glad of my 17 mile commute through pretty countryside, and the requirement (as a 'key' worker) for me to be at work, which has helped support my own mental health, something that has been fragile for many years. I am depressed that I'm not in a more significant role, able to better help people in need. I am bothered by the fact that the 'lockdown' has shown how barren my life is, but that I feel no ability to alter it, either now, or at the end of the current situation. I feel I'm struggling to properly engage with some of the more positive things that are happening - communities pulling together, activities online, reinforcements of ties between friends. I feel like social media, and the internet is proving both it's strengths and it's weaknesses at being a place to share both good and bad information, to make good and bad connections.

{"worry":2,"text_long":"I think there is a massive over reaction. We have given up our freedoms that, when the virus has passed, we will have great difficulty getting back. All this based on a virus that should be compared to previous outbreaks of illness such as Spanish Flu and Asian flu. On both occasions that these occured the results will be far worse than the current virus. The link between the 3 is that no vaccine was available for the Spanish Flu and none, initially, for the Asian Flu. The comparison will therefore be perfectly valid. Just a mass over reaction."}

It is becoming increasingly worrying and closer to home. I am furiously looking at the news constantly and hoping for remedies and prevention techniques to help myself fight this horrendous virus.

It seems to me that folk with cash and big gardens are trying to shame people who don't going out and acting sensibly. I think the government are doing an OK job but I really hope they don't try to become more draconian.

I watch each day's briefing and keep up with the daily figures but I try not to look too much into things as it just makes me more anxious.

I have to do online exams but I am finding it extremely hard to concentrate. I am happy to be able to do my part for the NHS and all the essential workers in the country.

I\u2019m enjoying spending time indoors with my family but it is hard to explain the current situation to my 5 year old & she keeps asking me when the virus is going to go away.

{"worry":6,"text_long":"I feel like the UK government have not done enough soon enough. I think lockdown should be more strict and enforced at this point as it is clear that not everyone is following the rules. I think increased security measures would come at further detriment to peoples wellbeing and financial situations however I believe it is necessary at this point to prevent this awful virus killing more of our loved ones and putting a strain on the NHS. When lockdown was originally announced I felt incredibly anxious about the whole situation in a way I have never experienced before. As the days have went on I have grown accustomed to life now however sometimes I will have moments of realising how crazy and saddening it all is. I have personally been very worried about the mental wellbeing of everyone around me most of all friends and family that can't get out the house due to being high risk. Personally, I'm not that worried about catching the virus itself as I am taking every safety precaution I possibly can but it is rather the knock on effects the lockdown has had on my life that induced the anxiety such as having a drastic reduction in my income and the strain of being locked in the house with my family.

{"worry":7,"text_long":"I think the Corona virus must be intricately related to how we have destroyed our global environment. I feel conflicted about it, because in many ways the current economic shutdown, especially the downing of planes, should have been the response, or similar, to declaring a climate emergency. We are still hurtling towards runaway global warming, and that is a collective insanity by any reasonable definition. The reduction in air pollution is also double edged. There is a phenomena called Global Dimming (which is in the IPCC report), where the pollution layer is blocking about 1 degree of extra warming about that pollution layer that has already occurred. The reduction of that pollution layer removes that reduction, and will potentially push us to the edge of runaway global warming. Global Dimming should be discussed. All of these crises are interrelated."}

We can only do our best by trying to distance ourselves and hand wash\/sanitise but this is difficult when you have to take a blood sample off someone.\nI know people blame our government for not issuing the correct PPE, but no one would have been prepared for this pandemic no matter how much planning was in place. \nPeople need to remember how serious this is, and keep their distance and not go out.\nFRIGHTENED !!!!\n"}

My eldest has extra help at school and I am worried he will fall behind because of this. \nThat gives me extra anxiety.\nAlso the age gap between them (3 years) makes it hard to do home school because the youngest is 4 so he ends up watching tv half the day which makes me feel like a terrible mother.
