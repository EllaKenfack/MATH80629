There is a lot of uncertainty at this moment in time, and although I know we will get through this, it\u2019s scary to see what the world will look like on the other side. It\u2019s tough to know that things will probably get worse before they get better and this may take some time. Sometimes when you are a few weeks behind the scale of the issue in some countries, you read the news in that country and it can be scary to think that it may be quite like this in my country. Also there is the uncertainty of not knowing what the government will do and how much limitations they will place on us. It is a strange way to be living right now with having to plan each meal, and when to go the shops and how to go the shop to buy provisions at quieter times and to try and avoid any crowds. I also worry about my family and friends who are all quite a long way away from me, and there is a sense of powerlessness that I feel sometimes. This is all quite negative but on the flip side there is opportunity in this in that I can try and work on self development and to put things into perspective and to realise that the fast paced lifestyle that we all lead is actually not the best way to live and in the future once we get through this hopefully people will put things into some sort of perspective and realise that there are more important things in life. It\u2019s also interesting to see how nature is taking a big breather from the impact we as humans have on the world and if there are no flights, factories shut, and less people consuming energy without reason then there could be a positive impact on nature and global warming, which at least would be a good by product from this uncertain and depressing times. Hopefully this will end and people will get used to the new normality but we can be more positive and open to each other and pool together globally for the better. The other scary side product of this is the impact on the financial world, and I think that this may be further reaching and be quite tough. This does worry me to as I don\u2019t know how it will affect me personally and also in the environment around me.

Before lock down I was anxious about me, my children, husband, siblings, parents and whilst i\u2019m Still anxious and the occasional trip to the supermarket has been heartbreaking as you can see how desperately sad everyone feels, the anxiety I had about lock down and the children coping were largely unfounded and the anxiety is now first and foremost about the virus."}

The result of this will be an enforced lockdown which will have a negative impact on people as the warm weather arrives in the coming months.

There are many indirect consequences of this virus and the I think one of the worst of those is the loneliness and isolation of many people especially the elderly, at this time.

I am annoyed that the government took so long to enforce social restrictions and lockdown procedures, especially because we could see how severe the disease was becoming in other countries. Even considering trying to develop 'herd immunity' was a selfish bid to protect the econonmy over the health of our people.

Their risk factor is very high. I'm not too worried about myself at the moment, as my risk factor is low due to my age.

I am generally quite happy with this situation, as much as it is stressful. I decided not to go home where I am from but stay in London instead. I think it is much better to be stuck in isolation on my own than with family\/friends, because if you want to see someone - you have videochats, but if you don't want to you have ways of escaping (you are already on your own).

Some of the people get mild symptoms and others get severe symptoms that might cause death. Also, the fact that there is only limited resources at the hospital for the equipments (masks, gloves, protective gear, respiratory ventilators and etc.) which cause the ones working in the hospital more potential to get the virus. Included in the limited resources is also the fact that there is not enough space in the hospital for people, so if you have severe symptoms there might be not for chance to get in hospital.

{"worry":6,"text_long":"I am one of the people who got a letter saying to stay in for 12 weeks so for me I am not anxious about when the lockdown will end because it won't end for me. I have severe asthma so I am a bit worried about getting it because I have a high risk of needing ventilation and of dying from it. Staying in really isn't an issue for me. I have been living with chronic illness since I was 12 and at my worst I was housebound for 2 years as a teenager so this is nothing compared to that. It has actually been annoying and anger inducing to see so many people complain about the lockdown and staying in, especially if they are middle class\/rich with nothing to really worry about, when I have been through worse and was completely ignored and forgotten about like so many others and the key workers are going through much worse too. People are finally experiencing what it is like to live as a disabled person where you have to cancel and grieve for events, stay in for days at a time and survive on what little money the government decides is enough for a week. But still these people can go out and exercise and we still can't. It is also very anger-inducing to see so many people flaunt the rules and go out for BBQs and sunbathing. Also plenty of people going out for 'exercise' are gathering in groups and not observing the 2-meter distance with strangers. I also find it sad that the scientific literacy is so poor in this country. People really don't understand simple things that are being told to them about how the virus works, the symptoms, when to self isolate and what the lockdown means. People are dying every day because of this stupidity. There are also way too many stupid people trying to take down 5G masts because they are transmitting the virus. There are no words for that level. I find there is a bit of toxic positivity and toxic productivity on facebook and social media in general. Like people sharing the numbers of recovered to focus on the positives because everyone else is talking about how many died when these deaths matter. It isn't just the flu. A few days ago a 13 year old died alone and now he has been buried alone with no funeral. I don't want to hear about the recovered because that shouldn't be the focus and people need to be more scared and panicked so they stay indoors and don't get complacent. There should be video from the ICUs on the TV every night to make people think. Many of my friends are taking up new hobbies and getting round to decluttering and finishing those jobs around the house you never end up doing. This is great for them and I am happy they can have some time where they aren't burned out by work constantly but it makes me feel bad because I can't do that. Being as ill as I am is like a full time job and my spare energy goes on cooking, showering and if I am lucky cleaning. I had a migraine yesterday and the most I managed to do was water my plants. I won't be joining my friends in fun creative pursuits and making my space nicer to live in during the lockdown.   I have had some darker thoughts too that maybe we deserve this. I don't believe in any higher power or some personification of mother nature but this has revealed the true nature of humanity in the west. When this started at first people just got really racist ranging from joking about Kung Flu to actually beating up ethnically Chinese people who may never have been to China. Then there was the panic buying of everyone for themselves and protecting their own and screw the rest. A week later I saw images of bins filled with rotting food they had over-purchased whilst elderly and disabled people went hungry because there was nothing in the shops or they couldn't book an online slot. Panic buying continued at pharmacies and now people are short on necessary prescription medication. And now there are people breaking social distancing for selfish reasons like when everyone treated it like a bank holiday and went to Mount Snowdon or just didn't bother because they would be fine if they got the virus. No care about those of us who are the worst affected. Even my aunt who is a nurse went out whilst having the virus to get shopping and medication and could have spread it to many more. It is just a shame that this virus disproportionately affects the elderly and sick and doesn't target selfish and stupid people instead. Now my main worry is about the antibody test because the government wants to get the country and the economy going because money matters most and will possibly allow those who are immune back to work and leave the rest of us behind. It could be that the healthy and young can go back to work and I will still be left behind until there is a vaccine. I really can't risk my life and will lose even more of it than I already have to illness if most people go back to normal. Right now everyone has been dragged nearer to my level so for me that feels okay and something I can live with. My friends are doing virtual socials and chatting online more when usually I have to cancel party invitations and skip nights out. I do have an academic interest in this too as I studied infectious diseases before so it has been frustrating to see the government go against a lot of public health research but interesting to read the latest articles on the biology of the virus. I am probably one of the few who is not getting scared at reading about the virus itself even though I am susceptible to it"}

Nowhere.\n\nI'm enraged by the promise of 100,000 tests a month for a test that doesn't exist in any meaningful way.\n\nI'm enraged by the government's inability to tell the truth about the supply about ventilators, or to actually use the UK firms that could have started manufacturing them weeks ago but didn't because the government wasn't interested.\n\nI'm frightened of my 73 year old partner getting the illness and dying.

I've done a bit of cooking today, played tetris with the freezers, done a bit of gardening, fixed a couple of things, done a bit of voluntary remote working, walked the dog and had a thoroughly satisfying day.  I have no other concerns in the world, and as a result I'm very conscious that I'm in a privilged tiny, tiny, tiny minority and a very lucky woman.

Panic buying has declined a great deal, social distancing seems to work for a high majority where I live but some still don't get the need to look after themselves and each other. Have signed a petition to see if live animal markets have tighter controls if not banned in China, as I believe that countries with this level of mentality should know better, change their barbaric ways.

I have a lot of mental problems and also an eating disorder that I feel could be triggered off with all this. At this moment I am feeling optimistic and ready for the surge ahead, but I am very scared. I think the unknown is a really lonely and sad place and I think that everyone is in the same boat, which does fill me with a sense of power and that we are all going to beat this together.

I've been round to my neighbours checking that they are all alright today and so far so good but I just wonder how long it will be before one of them becomes unwell.

I don't think people will necessarily think about things the same way as they did pre coronavirus.  People's lives and the way we view things could be drastically changed after this.

Instead of spending billions on weapons we will never use, all we needed was some social cooperation and fabric masks.

I hope that we can all just follow the advice so that we can get through this as quickly as we can.

I haven't stepped outside for 3 weeks now and I honestly think these people are selfish because before even thinking about people in the quarantine they should think about the NHS. They are working with sweat and anxiety just to keep people alive and the more people go out the more the NHS staff will suffer and so would we. I'm angry and upset. Look at the casualties!!!

On the other hand, I\u2019m truly horrified by the authoritarian streak that has been revealed in many people, and am disgusted at the way that rather than promoting community understanding some individuals are calling for people to be shot in the street for going for a walk.

If she catches Covid-19 on top on that, with her two other risk groups... I'm genuinely frightened she'll die. If the situation gets worse, she might not even get a ventilator if she needs one.

From a personal health point I am quite vulnerable and news reports are terrifying. I am tremendously sad for those who have lost loved ones so far and fear for more tragedies. I am angry with the initial response from Gvmt, I feel that the threat of this illness was not taken account of sufficiently and quickly enough and the economy was prioritised. My hope is that the form of socialism the Tories have been forced to adopt will somehow be recognised as the only way a nation should continue but fear that in fact, a harsher austerity package than we have seen prior to C19 will be employed, and that will kill just as many poor, disabled and sick people as this virus.

Its just hoping that none of us get a very serious, deadly, version of the illness. It is scary that going outside for your daily exercise of for essentials could be the cause of you contracting a serious virus - especially when people are not observing the social distancing rules.

It was something over nothing to begin with but is a dangerous threat which at the minute doesn't look like it can be stopped or slowed down.

At the end of the day our health and wellbeing is the most important thing and we are lucky that we are all together safe and well at home rather than outside exposed to the virus.

Of course, I could be proven wrong in the future, but based on the statistics currently available, I don't think it is that series for me.

I worry about the economy and the effect this current situation will have on both the economy of this country and of the world.  I feel anxious every day about catching the virus, what that would mean and how I would react to it.       "}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"I am scared for the economy and the people within society. The fact that it has come to lockdown throughout the country really emphasises how serious this virus is for everyone and how dangerous it really is. I am terrified that this could affect someone I know. I am also apprehensive about how long that this will last for. The fact that even our Prime Minister is in intensive care with it now really shows how dangerous this virus is and reiterates to us all that we are not taking this as seriously as we should be. "}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"Worried, for my family as there seems no vaccine will be about soon and it is just a matter of time, even with social distancing and lockdown, before we all get infected.  Also slightly more worried as I work in a supermarket, so I am potentially more likely do be exposed.\nThe world situation does not seem to be getting any better so I do not think this will go away any time soon and will have a long lasting effect on all of our lives. I do believe the Government is doing the right thing and everyone should adhere to their instructions."}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"Feeling anxious and scared about the future. I'm scared of getting I'll or my family getting ill. I do think we all had it before it was announced. We were all so I'll in January, and my newborn was rushed to hospital on oxygen. They didn't know what was wrong. When will life get back to normal? Will it ever get back to normal. I have 3 year old and a 5 month old. Its the not knowing and nobody knowing about the future that is so scary. I feel like we are living in a film and one day I will wake up. I miss my family and friends. I miss sitting in a coffee shop.  Even though I am scared, I am hopeful things will turn out ok... At some point!"}
{"worry":9,"text_long":"I'm a bit scared and trying not to leave my house when it's not needed. I'm taking care of my baby son so I must be ever more careful as I'm also responsible for him. Im not doing shopping anymore as this is getting done by my husband from now as going to the shop with a baby that just started to walk would be a huge risk. To catch some 'fresh' air we are having fun at the garden from time to time as sitting at home can become really depressing especially with the little one alone. It's a tough time for everyone and in my opinion people should stay at home if they have a possibility but at the weekend I hear groups of drunk people outside so I do not really think that all the people taking the situation seriously."}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"My mum is a front-line worker and so I am perpetually anxious about her and my family contracting the virus. I'm extremely worried about my chances of survival if I contract it as I am chronically ill. I'm also deathly worried for my parents, who aren't really in the most at-risk age group but are still 'older' and my father has a history of strokes. It kind of feels like an inevitability that we will contract it and feeling like someone (or possible multiple of people in my family) could die feels like a mind-numbing reality. I feel like I'm sitting around waiting to die all the time. \n\nIn general the situation feels bleak. I feel like I have the most sympathy and concern for still-developing countries and refugees who are either displaced or people from war-torn countries. What hope do they have. The knock-on effects from this on a global scale will be so painful. "}
{"worry":5,"text_long":"Right now I\u2019m apprehensive. I face redeployment to the frontline in the next few days. I feel anxious about impact of that on me and my health, I fear the impact on my children. I\u2019m angry that there is an unfair division of labour and some are expected more than others. I\u2019m also relaxed in some ways as My husband has been furloughed and can look after the children. It\u2019s a complex ever changing mix of emotions that is continually evolving as the situation around me changes quickly. I\u2019m acutely aware of my feelings and my response and am tracking my emotions closely and implementing coping strategies to keep me calm despite my concerns. "}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"I feel very anxious, I am the daughter of a key worker (radiotherapist). Although my parent is not high risk or frontline he still treats suspected COVID patients which is anxiety inducing.\nEverything is very uncertain which adds to anxiety and fear.\n\nI am also a physician associate student. My placement has been cancelled and my future uncertain. There is talk of us being paid and working as if we are qualified to help on the front line which, to be honest, scares me. From what I have seen, PPE is not up to CDC or WHO standard.\n"}
{"worry":3,"text_long":"I am not particularly worried about the coronavirus situation as my daily life before quarantine consisted of staying at home, so I am unaffected. I am, however, disappointed in the reluctance shown by people in power to lock down their respective countries in order to slow the spread of the virus. I am also rather disgusted by the young people who think it is okay to go outside, catch the virus, and give it to their grandparents or other older people. Irresponsible people, such as those who \"\"\"\"jokingly\"\"\"\" cough in elderly persons' faces, also give me feelings of disgust."}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"I feel worried that we haven't done enough to contain this issue and that we started far too late. I'm worried for my parents who are at risk and for my job. I do not believe our government is competent or honest, I believe they have botched and will continue to botch this problem. \n\nIt's good that they've taken steps to help the economy but I imagine they'll need to go further. When this is over a lot of these measures should continue - to genuinely provide help in society for those that need it most. "}
{"worry":2,"text_long":"I feel very relaxed about the situation. My immediate family are all at low risk. We are social distancing in the ideal situation, with a reasonably sized house and garden and no underlying health conditions. I feel mildly worried for my dad who is over 70 with high blood pressure and does not seem to be taking this seriously enough, but my overriding feeling is one of gratitude that my immediate family are in no danger and living comfortably. I am self employed and have slightly less work, but we have taken a mortgage holiday and our general outgoings are reduced by staying at home, so we don't have financial worries. I feel slight guilt that we are in such a fortunate situation whilst others are suffering and that I cannot volunteer for the NHS because my husband is already a key worker. I feel slightly sad that my children are missing out on their regular activities but aware that they are lucky to do them in normal times. I don't socialise much anyway so I am not really missing the social interaction. I feel I am in as good a position as it is possible to be in under the circumstances and I am grateful for that. "}
{"worry":8,"text_long":"I feel sad that I can't see my grandparents. I feel like it's  a year wasted when I was going to try and better myself from my anxiety and depression. I can't do that now as we can't go out. I hope I get more good years with my mum and dad to make up for this year. I'm missing thing's like the concerts and football and going out. Going to visit my grandparents on a Tuesday afternoon. But I know that it is all to keep thme safe. It's annoying me that others are flouting the rules and putting others lives in danger"}
{"worry":6,"text_long":"I'm worried about it.  Even though I am only going to the store once a week I feel like I'll probably pick it up from there!  I have decided to go on a dating site to get a headstart on meeting new people when the lockdown is over so I actually feel kind of relaxed and excited for when this is all over.  I have also been trying to keep preoccupied by talking to people, playing games, reading books instead of news articles as I feel like this just makes me panic more and I find distraction and looking towards the future is more helpful."}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"I feel anxious constantly but it\u2019s in the background. Today has felt better because I\u2019m not at work so it\u2019s not been at the forefront of my mind. If I think about it I can\u2019t quite get my head around it all. I feel scared that it\u2019s going to get or that someone I know could get it. Initially I wasn\u2019t too worried but now people are dying and it scares me to think someone I know could actually die from this. It\u2019s just so surreal and unbelievable. I work in a hospital so I hear about the realities of the situation. This doesn\u2019t help my anxiety but at the same time I want more information "}
{"worry":4,"text_long":"I feel not too concerned, certainly not as concerned as I was. I am anxious for my sister who is on immunosuppressants and my dad who has an autoimmune disorder, but overall I do not feel that anxious. I feel guilty about saying it but there are some positives to the situation. I am a keyworker so I still have to travel into London to work and the trains are very empty so my journey has improved significantly which I am happy about, but I feel guilty that I am happy about that. Apart from this I feel anxious, a bit concerned, but not necessarily fearful."}
{"worry":5,"text_long":"I mostly feel frustrated, by the poor and underwhelming actions of the UK government. I feel they have done the bare minimum, responded far too late at every turn, and have been callous\/unfeeling in their willingness to let people die. I also feel some anxiety for the wellbeing of myself and my family; that we will be financially secure during and after the crisis. I am worried thinking about my uncle, who has very serious MS and would be at huge risk of dying if he contracted the virus. However, I feel some hope\/admiration at the way many people have responded, with expressions of solidarity and support for each other and for the key workers on the frontline, for example NHS workers. Then again, I feel frustrated that the NHS has been deliberately underfunded by various Tory governments for a decade, and now are being placated by 'thanks' and claps, when the most important thing the NHS needs is money."}
{"worry":2,"text_long":"I feel OK about it, it's a concern but my job is secure. Everyone I know is safe. I'm enjoying the community spirit at the minute. Many people have felt isolated by it but I dont. I feel more included and more connected than ever before. However, I'm a little concerned that too many people are going out, we will be on full lock down before we know it!! I don't want to be on lock down because I want to be able to go for a walk, all the while keeping my distance from others . It's annoying that a lot of people don't seem to be able to follow these rules or understand the importance of it."}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"Fearful I may carry and give the virus to my daughter. Frustrated as a key worker I am required to continue working and will no doubt be required to pay more tax to repay the amount being given out at the moment. Fearful that as a key worker along with my wife that I need to put my daughter in nursery so I can go to work while everyone else is able to spend around three months with their families. Frustrated at people who are not adhering to the lockdown terms for there own benefit despite the amount of literacy around telling people to not do this, all this will ultimately lead to lockdown lasting for longer than anticipated. "}
{"worry":6,"text_long":"Angry at the way the government has treated the NHS over the past ten years thus when it comes to a pandemic it is not prepared so what they now have to do is throw money into it and claim they could not foresee this. Correct they could not but the NHS would have been much more prepared if it was funded correctly prior to this. I am also angry at the way some of our population is ignoring social distancing despite multiple pleas from NHS workers, however, not as angry as I am with the current government. "}
{"worry":6,"text_long":"I am enraged because I can't go on a date.  That is literally the only reason for my anger.  I enjoy using Tinder and I am being prevented!  Furthermore, I can't go to the gym which I would describe as 'irritating'.  I would rather know we were stuck in for six months than have the feeling of the unknown.  Also, as a shop worker I feel that store assistants should be allowed to wear face masks.  Social distancing is one thing, but what about industrial distancing?! I have baked more cakes than normal due to avoiding trips to the shop for biscuits."}
{"worry":9,"text_long":"i feel like nothing will ever be the same again and that humans will take a long time to get back to some form of normality.\nI am fearful for my parents health and wellbeing and it is very frustrating not seeing friends.\ni am hoping that humans will learn a lesson from this and fund the correct things in the future, like research, medicine, hospitals etc.\nI have seen the best of and the worst of the human spirit recently with a rise in crime =s like theft from the poor but also seen some great volunteers out there helping those in need."}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"I feel like people aren't taking it serious enough. I worked in a pharmacy for 7 years and I want everyone to know how bad these things can be. Social media doesn't help at all.\nSeeing President Trump expose himself as someone who doesn't really think about the lesser off persons is a sad thing. I have friends in America who are from China and feel personally attacked every time he takes the stage. There's so many things that I want to tell them but the isolation prevents it. I can't understand how anyone believes anything that he says. Not listening to doctors advice, lying to the press and seemingly still having the support of any seems mind boggling to me. "}
{"worry":4,"text_long":"There is nothing I can do, it's out of my control so I'm just taking it day by day. As a recovered agoraphobic I worry about getting back out there in the future and hope my anxiety about going out isn't increased. I do get annoyed at people who do not adhere to the 2m rule and walk right by me on the street when I have no place to move. Its infuriating when people don't listen to the advice, today I saw people playing football in the park. Sometimes it's hard being stuck at home as you run out of things to do but I try to be productive, exercise and that's all we can do!"}
