I spend a lot of spare time taking online science courses about Covid-19, which is very interesting.  I read recently that this situation could go on for another year and a half, which means that our lives are going to be so changed and uncertain for ages.   And does that mean I won't get to see my parents again for all that time?  That makes me a bit sad.  At the same time as feeling worried about these things, I feel that this is something that is totally out of my control beyond the sensible precautions that I can take, and it is something that is no-one's fault.

Angry that I'm off work, no money, no idea if I'll have a job at the end of all this, angry at idiots who try to exploit the system, people who selfishly hog all the food.

I am worried about the long term economic implications and how that will impact people's lives, just as the austerity that followed the 2008 financial crisis caused huge suffering and reduced life expectancy for many.

Overall I don't see this as a depressing or sad time, in general. Around 4% of all motorcycle accidents result in death, but people seem to be riding motorcycles without any worries; I try to see it like that.

There is also many people who I have come across when shopping for basic supplies who are not following rules regarding social distancing.

Lots of people are going out in droves and not observing social distancing rules, because they're very non-chalant about it.\nMeanwhile, my partner is immuno-supressed and very worried about everything, my company is on the verge of failing, and it's impossible to do any shopping because everyone is panic-buying stuff that they're likely going to chuck away very soon anyway. On the plus side, I'm getting more time to exercise and more time to catch up on some xbox games I haven't played for years.\n"}

The UK is hardly in its hardest times yet so many things have gone wrong or have been negatively affected already. Personally, not being able to see the people I have been closest to recently is having a detrimental effect on my mental health, and self-isolation is proving to have an effect on my physical health. I wish to see my friends and to go about my daily life however I understand that these are things I will have to put on hold for the time being.

I am also concerned about family members and making sure they are kept as safe as possible. It is unnerving to me that people are ignoring government guidelines and continuing to go out in large groups and attend gatherings in public places. I am reassured to a certain extent as the death toll is very low in comparison with the entire population of the United Kingdom, however it is concerning that so many people are falling ill with this disease.

Perhaps.\nWill my mental health be fine at the end of it all? I do not mean to be selfish, but I can only care about myself in the immediate."}

I feel that all the working from home and changes to living standards might help to slightly reform our society for the better when this is done - I look forward to that happening.  I also think the world is realising (as a result of the virus) that we share the planet with each other and with nature, in particular I'm loving how nature is reappearing in places all over the world.  I try and look forward to events I have planned further down the year - but remain nervous that these might also get cancelled each passing week.  I miss my friends and social experiences - especially heading out together and going for runs together.\n\nI support our governments approach - appreciating they've had a very tough line to tread between economic collapse and public health.  It's economic collapse that actually worries me more than the virus itself - that will last far longer than a few months of lockdown!!!  If that can be averted, potentially at the cost of a marginally worse public health outcome, I feel the country would be happier on the whole in the long run.  (Sorry that's a bit of an extreme view I know!)"}

It greatly affect the larger group of more outgoing people, or those in need of jobs that currently have to be let go from work or stay at home with a very low paid holiday wage,  Students of seconday schools and those who are due to do their test next month are also postponed with their exams which means most of their studies have gone to waste."}

There are some benefits to the planet in terms of climate change and it has highlighted some negative things in our way of life, so for this there is a positive side that we can be happy with if we all stay safe and obey the lockdown. The most concerning thing in my opinion is the upcoming recession\/depression because if people are still out of work well after the pandemic, there will be a more severe problem which is the collapse of the global economy, having such a major and volatile event might lead to unrest in the world and the possibility of war."}

Getting normal supplies\/groceries is a near constant frazzling battle. I'm quite worried about how to resolve these problems, especially as I'm unlikely to get a better-paid job now. I live with my disabled mother who's over 60 so that's another cause for concern for me. On a bigger scale, the global death toll is so saddening. The amount of lives & jobs & families & businesses it's disrupted is astonishing. It makes me frustrated, concerned, unhappy, and exasperated in equal measure."}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"I am very sad that the government have let us get in this situation by taking so long to act. The figures rising every day is particularly scary that the scale of this virus is constantly spreading and hurting more people. The stupidity of some members of the public still going out and about makes me angry and frustrated that they have so little consideration for those most at risk. I worry that this will continue for a long time and really affect peoples finances and living situations. The uncertainty of when we can go back to our normal lives makes me anxious."}

It is extremely emotional to see people lose members of their family due to the virus. I am proud of our healthcare workers for the hard work they are putting in whilst i am also grateful for out other essential workers. At this very moment, I am tired and stressed. I am fed up of constantly being at home but I understand why I am here. It frustrates me how much the news constantly repeat themselves and NEVER have anything positive to say. This is a worrying time but the news and TV do not help peoples emotions and worries by constantly being negative. "}
{"worry":6,"text_long":"The corona situation at these times is very difficult but it helps us find ourselves again and slows down humanity allowing everyone to reflect.People going out have only themselves to blames for contracting the virus. It does make me feel slightly scared that people are ignorant and don\u2019t listen strictly to the rules. Also it is threatening for the economy as people aren\u2019t working and Markets have fallen in value. However the positive is it allows people of all religions to pray and focus on God and allow others to spend more time on immediate household family and get work done they might not have been able to do due to work etc. Allowing us all to actually come together as a nation is warming and shows the power of humans if we all unite"}

I am also worried about the number of deaths in my city as the number is slowly rising and the number of infected is getting quite high too. I'm also worried that I wont be able to find a job as I have been unemployed for several months now"}
{"worry":7,"text_long":"The situation with coronavirus at the moment is rather worrying. The amount of cases and deaths is raising rapidly. The fact it came from China\u2019s wet markets, and they have now reopened those wet markets disgusts me. They should learn from their mistakes! I am proud of Britain coping the way it is. I am angry at the selfish people though, who continue to go out and enjoy the sunshine. My partner is classed as a key worker and I am worried that he will come into contact with someone with the virus and that he will get ill.\nI hope Britain can get over it quickly and the country can get back on its feet."}
{"worry":6,"text_long":"I feel anxious as the numbers keep rising ..it makes you worry about if you do catch it because even though got no underlying health problems , younger people do still die. I am hoping the deaths start to go down now because there was a decrease today and it's been 2 weeks since lockdown so hopefully will start to see the effects of that. I'm scared to go to supermarket but know I have to as here are no online delivery slots . And I appreciate these are for vulnerable and I can get to the shop, but it's made us all so scared and have to disinfect all the packaging when get home because loads of people would have touched the items. Also become anxious about cleaning and disinfecting the house every day even though not been out. On a plus note, it has made everyone just slow down which I think is great. It makes us all realise all the money we spend on stuff we dont need and we have time now to sort stuff out in the house, read a book etc. But I miss being able to go for  a picnic or drive to a nice place for a walk "}

So i think country shoud go for a total lock down for few weeks at least so this can be controlled than now"}
{"worry":9,"text_long":"The uncertainty of this unprecedented situation is deeply worrying. It is the uncertainty that unsettles me the most. How many people will ultimately be affected physically? What will the final mortality number be? What will we be able to learn and ascertain about the virus itself? How will our economy recover? Has anyone thought of the added bill to the NHS for the impending mental health issues this may all cause? It's all just so unknown and the fear of the unknown is the biggest of all. Personally speaking, I feel extremely fortunate to not feel affected though that too may change. My children are thankfully healthy and my parents, too. I was looking after my mother after she sustained a subarachnoid haemorrhage, she was discharged from hospital 3 weeks ago which is unbelievably fortunate timing.

{"worry":4,"text_long":"I'm worried about other people more than myself. Been furloughed from work but that's actually a positive at the moment and has helped me feel less anxious than I was before.\n\nOlder people do need to take the whole situation more seriously as they're the ones not abiding by the distancing rules and that makes me more worried about them, and the possibility that they're spreading the virus. \n\nThe financial situation is the biggest worry, with wage cut to 80% at the moment, assuming that comes through. Plus the concern that the business I work for may not survive this situation. Therefore it is important for to try not to spend money other than on essentials as I may need it to tide me over until I can find a new job after things reopen. Other businesses may also not be hiring due to financial worries."}
{"worry":6,"text_long":"Slightly worried about current events, especially unemployment. This is because the economy is right now in a bad state, with the interest rates at a all time low and the unemployment rate lower than the level during the great depression, at the moment the economy could be in a worse state than the 2008 recession. This is also because it is not the bursting of a bubble like the housing market or the internet bubble, but it is a global pandemic, which is affecting health and in turn affecting the economy"}
{"worry":1,"text_long":"I am not particularly scared because I am young and are more likely to recover from it and i know the procedure to stop the spread of the virus and know that I am not putting myself at risk. The most anxiety comes from spreading to other people who are not as healthy as I am, which is a horrible feeling. To see how many people have died from the virus has made me feel afraid for the families who have to watch loved ones die without being able to say goodbyes fully and have to see them die without being comforted in their transition."}

We are all in a liminal, uncertain state of being - I feel a bit hollowed out rather than any one emotion. The anxiety and fear has tapered off in recent weeks but I think this is desensitisation rather than it going away. It feels like a never ending situation that I would like the world to collectively come out of, as if exiting a bad dream. "}

Days have become monotonous with minor variation which is slowly having a negative effect on my mental health. "}

We just have to calm down, follow the guidelines as much as possible, and it'll be over and done with at some point. If there is one thing I do somewhat worry about though, or rather feel slightly contemptuous about, it's the thoughtlessness and selfishness of food hoarders.

I did not state number 10 for these two because I suppose I empathise with their desire to keep mentally sane by seeing their family and friends but I feel they are being unfair because the more of us that keep to lock down rules, the more positive our future will be with respect to Corona and the death tolls rising. \n\nI am anxious for each oerson's future and what this holds, especially my daughter as she is only 8 years old and I can tell is constantly growing fear rapidly, the more and more we hear about the effects Corona is having on people daily, all over the world."}

In a way, I am torn between allowing myself to be a little less strict with my work ethic, as an adjustment to this new lifestyle, and being concerned about where this will lead me career-wise in the long-term, and if the latter even matters as much as it mattered before, considering the current circumstances.

I think in this way, we can reduce the risk of the coronavirus affecting us invidually, and this can reduce our own personal stress levels and happiness. We can take this time to focus on projects that we have not had time for before, or focus on relaxation.
